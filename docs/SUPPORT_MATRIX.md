# Supported Runtime Matrix

Support is evidence-based. A version is supported only after its fixture suite and a
target-process run pass. Source compatibility or a successful build is not sufficient.

| Engine profile | Fixture | Current status | Enabled capabilities | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UE 4.26 x64 | Missing | Not supported | None claimed | Object/name arrays, offsets, ProcessEvent, bytecode, property codecs, SDK/USMAP consumer, clean unload |
| UE 4.27 x64 | Missing | Not supported | None claimed | Object/name arrays, offsets, ProcessEvent, bytecode, property codecs, SDK/USMAP consumer, clean unload |
| UE 5.x x64 with LWC | Missing | Not supported | None claimed | FName/ObjectArray profile, LWC FVector/FRotator codecs, ProcessEvent, bytecode, SDK/USMAP consumer, clean unload |

## Fixture requirements

Each fixture must record:

1. Exact engine version and executable identity.
2. Expected GObjects, GNames/FNamePool, GWorld, ProcessEvent, and critical offsets.
3. Stable object handles including index and serial.
4. Representative scalar, string, object, struct, array, map, set, delegate, soft
   object, FVector, and FRotator properties.
5. Native and Blueprint functions with input, output, in-out, and return parameters.
6. A deterministic Watch mutation and bounded Hook event source.
7. Expected C++ SDK, USMAP, Dumpspace, and IDA artifact validation results.
8. Connect, disconnect, reconnect, cancellation, and clean unload traces.

Until a fixture exists, the corresponding profile remains `Not supported`; offset or
layout heuristics must not upgrade that status.
